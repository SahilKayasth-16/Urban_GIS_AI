🏙️ Urban GIS AI

AI Chatbot + GIS Integrated Web Platform for Urban Planning & Utility Management

📌 Project Overview

Urban GIS AI is a web-based platform developed as an internship project that integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with an AI-powered chatbot to support urban planning and business decision-making.

The system allows users to select a location on an interactive map, ask natural language queries (e.g., “I want to open a gym in Ahmedabad”), and receive data-driven insights such as population density, utility availability, and analytical recommendations.
